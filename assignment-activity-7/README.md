# **Online Bookstore Data Interchange: XML and JSON - Assignment Activity 7**

## **Assignment Overview**

As a developer for an online bookstore, your task is to efficiently manage data interchange between the server and client. The bookstore's catalog includes books with various attributes such as titles, authors, publication years, genres, and availability status. You will work with **both XML and JSON** to structure, validate, and manipulate the bookstore's data.

## **Tasks**

### **1. Design an XML Schema (XSD)**

Create an **XML Schema (XSD)** to define the structure of the bookstore's catalog. Your schema should include:

- **Root Element:** `<catalog>`
- **Book Element:** `<book>` with attributes:
  - `id` (string)
  - `available` (boolean)
- **Title Element:** `<title>` (string) with a sub-element:
  - `<publicationYear>` (integer)
- **Author Element:** `<author>` with sub-elements:
  - `<firstName>` (string)
  - `<lastName>` (string)

### **2. Create JSON Data Structure**

Design a **JSON structure** to represent the bookstore's inventory, ensuring it includes at least **three book entries**. Your JSON should contain:

- An **array** of books, where each book has:
  - `title` (string)
  - `author` (object) with:
    - `firstName` (string)
    - `lastName` (string)
  - `publicationYear` (integer)
  - `details` (object) with:
    - `publisher` (string)
    - `pageCount` (integer)
  - `available` (boolean)

## **Objectives**

- Understand the differences between **XML and JSON** for data interchange.
- Implement **validation** and **parsing** techniques for both formats.
- Optimize data handling for efficiency and maintainability.

## **Submission Guidelines**

- Provide a valid **XSD file** for the XML schema.
- Submit a **JSON file** containing sample book data.
- Include a brief explanation of why **JSON or XML** may be preferable for different use cases in your online bookstore.
